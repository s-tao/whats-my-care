# What's My CARE

What's My CARE is a full-stack web application that allows users to input their 
information to see all the insurance plans that they can qualify for. Users can 
save as many insurance plans as they choose to and remove any plans that they 
are no longer interested in. Users can also find providers who accepts their 
saved plans.

This project was created in February 2020 in the course of four weeks, at an 
all-female coding bootcamp, Hackbright Academy.
